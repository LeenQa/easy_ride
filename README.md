# easy_ride
EasyRide is a ride-sharing mobile application
where drivers publish trips they plan on taking
and passengers can request to join for a cost.
On top of that, users of the application can
exchange messages, and post reviews about
drivers.

The application was developed
with Dart & Flutter. Firebase Firestore, Storage,
and Authentication were used for user & data
management. Moreover, different Google APIs
were integrated into the application for maps
and locations services.
